Crowd Hire README

Collect and redact resumes (work required: 2)
-Collect resumes through piazza posts for our classmates, through public resume lists, social outreach (facebook), and/or club resume lists. We will have to redact personal information, such as name, email address, and phone number, from the resumes, once acquired. 

Create HIT templates (work required: 3)
-We have the mockup, but need to convert it into a usable Mechanical Turk HIT. It will take four resumes, one being a gold standard resume and the other three being distributed from the remaining resumes. For each resume the worker will answer a few basic questions such as what industry the person has worked in, years of experience, education, and skills.

Create gold standard answers (work required: 2)
-Answer the questions optimally for some number of resumes (to be determined) in order to generate proper gold standard questions for the HITs.

Collect data from crowd (work required: 1)
-Properly distribute the resumes into batches so that they may be put into groups of four to make the HITs available to publish.
-Publish HITs with the resumes we have collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Aggregate data and quality control (work required: 4)
-Filter for quality control based on gold standard
	-If worker fails gold standard, then his work will not be included in aggregation
-Determine majority aggregated questions to generate results for each resume. Depending on the question, this may be a simple average of numerical data or could be a more complicated operation done on a set of words. Present this data in the desired fashion.

Analyze data (work required: 4)
-Calculate metrics and final results based on data collected by the crowd. Depending on requirements this could be a presentation of data in a usable format, a ranking of resumes based on given requirements, or labeling resumes with certain keywords so that they are easily searchable for an interested employer.
